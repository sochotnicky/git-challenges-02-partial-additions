Task
====

Your task is to commit changes in this repository. To make things more
interesting, you have to create 2 commits - one for each method that was added
to the main.py


Solution
========
This type of task can be best finished using "git add -p". This will start
"addition mode" where git will start asking questions about which changed chunks
you want to add to index for future committing. 

Usually you can split the chunks into smaller pieces by typing "s". This is
helpful if git offers you a big chunk that includes both pieces you want to add
to the next commit and pieces you want to leave for later.

This example however doesn't work with split because we want to split a single
continuous chunk. For these instances we can start edit mode (type "e"). This
will start your favorite EDITOR - just remove the second method (print_square)
and save the file. Now you have the square method in the index - you can do git
commit. And then follow up with git commit -a - since you'll want to commit all
remaining changes.
